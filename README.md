Museum Data Analysis and Data Exploration

This project involves analyzing and organizing museum-related data to extract meaningful insights. It provides a structured approach to exploring patterns and trends in the dataset, making the information easier to understand and use.

We use a simple Python script to upload data from CSV files to MS SQL Server tables. We then use SQL queries to answer over 20+ problems related to the famous paintings dataset.
